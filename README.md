# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

At this stage:

**Set up an Express project
- Using Linters to find errors and maintain code consistency. There are a variety of linters out there, but the one we're going to use is called ESLint.
- Create an entry point by create an Express server inside of it and configure it to run on port 3001.
**Create a database and connect it to the server
- Using Mongoose
- Create schemas and models
**Implement a temporary authorization solution
- Create a test user via Postman

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
